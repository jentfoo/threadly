/**
 * <p>This differs from {@link org.threadly.concurrent.NoThreadScheduler} in that time is ONLY 
 * advanced via the tick calls.  That means that if you schedule a task, it will be scheduled off 
 * of either the creation time, or the last tick time, what ever the most recent point is.  This 
 * allows you to progress time forward faster than it could in real time, having tasks execute 
 * faster, etc, etc.</p>
 * 
 * <p>The tasks in this scheduler are only progressed forward with calls to {@link #tick()}.  
 * Since it is running on the calling thread, calls to {@code Object.wait()} and 
 * {@code Thread.sleep()} from sub tasks will block (possibly forever).  The call to 
 * {@link #tick()} will not unblock till there is no more work for the scheduler to currently 
 * handle.</p>
