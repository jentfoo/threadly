/**
 * <p>Abstract implementation for more complicated recurring behavior.  Unlike submitting a task 
 * to {@link SubmitterScheduler#scheduleWithFixedDelay(Runnable, long, long)}, this can provide 
 * the ability to only have the task scheduled if there is work to do.  In addition it provides the 
 * ability to change the frequency of execution without needing to remove and re-add the task.</p>
 * 
 * <p>This task will only schedule or reschedule itself if it has been notified there is work to 
 * do.  It is assumed that after execution all work is complete.  If there is additional work to 
 * perform, then the task should invoke {@link #signalToRun()} before it completes to ensure that 
 * it is rescheduled at the current set delay.  Because of that behavior there is no way to remove 
 * this task from the scheduler, instead you must just ensure that {@link #signalToRun()} is not 
 * invoked to prevent the task from rescheduling itself.</p>
 * 
 * <p>An additional advantage to using this over scheduling a recurring task is that you don't 
 * have to worry about removing the task before garbage collection occurs (ie no cleanup, just 
 * stop invoking {@link #signalToRun()}).</p>
